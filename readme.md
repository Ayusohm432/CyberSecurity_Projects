üõ°Ô∏è StegoShield: A Steganography Suite

Welcome to StegoShield, a comprehensive steganography tool designed to hide data in plain sight. This project provides two distinct applications‚Äîa native Desktop GUI and a browser-based WebApp‚Äîboth powered by the same core steganography engine.

Steganography is the art of concealing a message, image, or file within another message, image, or file. StegoShield implements this by subtly altering the pixel data of a carrier image to embed your secret data, making it visually imperceptible.

‚ú® Core Features (Both Applications)
Encode Text in Image: Hide a secret text message within a standard image file.

Decode Text from Image: Extract a hidden text message from a StegoShield-encoded image.

Encode Image in Image: Conceal a smaller secret image inside a larger carrier image.

Decode Image from Image: Recover a hidden image from its carrier.

Lossless Output: All encoded images are saved in the PNG format to ensure the integrity of the hidden data.

üñ•Ô∏è StegoShield Desktop
A user-friendly graphical application built with Python and Tkinter for a native desktop experience.

Desktop Features
Intuitive Tabbed UI: Easy-to-navigate interface separating each function.

Side-by-Side Previews: Compare original and processed images before saving the final result.

Integrated Help Guide: A built-in help tab explains the application's functionality and rules.

File Dialogs: Simple browsing for local file selection and saving.

Setup & Run (Desktop)

The application will be accessible in your web browser at: http://127.0.0.1:5000

üìñ How Steganography Works in StegoShield
The core steganography.py script uses the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique. Here's a simplified overview:

Data Conversion: The secret message or image is first converted into a binary string (a sequence of 1s and 0s).

Payload Creation: To ensure data can be correctly decoded, a payload is constructed containing:

A type bit (0 for text, 1 for image).

Header data (e.g., the length of the message or dimensions of the secret image).

The actual binary data of the secret.

Embedding: The application
